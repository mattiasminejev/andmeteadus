Our motivation is to create something interesting and useful. Also for people to see how to be a better student.     
        
Goal 1: Train a model to predict how will the student perform academically    
Goal 2: Analyse what kind of students perform the best    
Goal 3: Analyse which factors impact which test results the most.    


The repository has a codefile for the trained model, project plan, csv file for the data and the poster.
    
How to use:     
    1. Go to Project_code.ipynb file, change the file="..." to your file and from data_cleaned drop the columns that you do not need in the testing.
